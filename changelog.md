* Fixes an issue with unique validation
* Fixes population issues when passing nested structs
* Fixes issues with nested keys on normalization
* Adds auto-eviction prior to population
* Adds explicit closing to cursor use for single record retrieval

### Changed

* Fixes issues with unexpected driver return types
* Adds `offset()` helper method (alias for `set_offset()`) to ActiveEntity
* Adds `isObjectId()` helper method to MongoUtil for detecting whether an object is a Mongo _id string


## [v3.2.0.1]

## [v3.2.0.0]

### Changed

* Updates MongoDB Java driver to version 3.2.0

## [v3.1.0.4:]

### Changed

* Adds validation methods for entities and support for new property `ForceValidation`, which will prevent saving of documents which do not validate
* Adds auto-normalization capabilities for schema properties.  When attributes are configured, schema will auto-normalize when set() and populate() methods are called.
* Implements full support for component accessors on all schema properties.  Var safe accessor closures are generated to allow recursion through an underscore delimiter (e.g. `getFirstLevel_SecondLevel()` to retrieve `getDocument().FirstLevel.SecondLevel`)
* Fixes native CFML data types not being sanitized on deeply nested structs and arrays.
* Add getDocument() and asStruct() utility methods, which can be used on unloaded and unloaded entities.
* Adds append() and prepend() functions to assit in managing document schema arrays.
* Fixes issues with property maps not being defined correctly and correct casting of boolean property defaults.
* Adds MongoIndexer singleton to delegate index management away from Entity instances.

## [v3.1.0.3:]

### Changed

* Fixes issue with connections not being pooled accurately and adds connection closing to module unload
* Moves module bindings to onLoad() to ensure availability of cbjavaloader module
* Changes return type of all single record retrievals inserts and updates to native structs and adds auto-stringification of _id (eliminates the need for toString())
* Ensures version of returned object from findOneAndUpdate/findOneAndReplace operations is the after-save version

## [v3.1.0:]

### Changed

*  Removes Requirement For CFMongoDB Module
*  Adds Requirement for CBJavaloader Module
*  Implements MongoDB 3.0 Driver
*  Implements the ability to use multiple databases
